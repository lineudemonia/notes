2. It was raising US$200m of cash in its public offering
3. **7 key strategic components:**

	- Launch model s in 2012
	- Use a common platform (model s) to introduce new updates (both on the software patch and hardware upgrade)
	- Advance integrated engineering and manufacturing capabilities
	- Continue to focus on R&D and cost-saving
	- Expand propriatary sales network
	- Leverage industry advancement on battery cells
	- Build and leverage strategic relationship (as a new comer)

4. Risk factors
	- Limited operating history
	- history of losses
	- customer's willingness to switch to BEV
	- financing support
	- distribution cost 
	- production capaibility growth
	- delay in model s (2200 reservations by may 2010)

5. Key factors building model s

	- close manufacturing factory deal in fremont CA
	- secure funding
	- project design management
	- infrastructure building
	- successful simulation of tesla making - will reduce cost significantly compared with expensive real car safety trials
	- obtain gov permits
	- supplier management
	- deliver design to supplier timely
	- talent hiring
	- manufacturing mangament	
	- quality control

10. Estimate annual drive distance of 19000km, average electricity cost of USR11 cents per KWh, will have an approximately US$1900 savings over ICE cars
11. Model X early prototype revealed in feb 2012
12. battery pack is intentionally designed to be modular that it can easily migrate to future product needs
13. Plans to roll out a network of 90 kWh fast charging equipment - **SuperCharger (first time appeared)**
14. THere was debate on whether tesla can take reservations in advance at Cali DMV. Interesting risk
