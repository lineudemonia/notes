- Attendants believed the following components would enable the computer to acquire general intelligence (including emotional intelligence, creativity, moral reasoining etc):

	1. Reasoning (deep blue eg)
	2. Knowledge representation (what is an object etc)
	3. Planning (including navigation)

### AI Winters

**_Winter 1: Machine Translation_**    

- 1960s 
- Out of need of communicating with russian during cold war
- Leading player was IBM
- Only captured syntatic translation instead of semantic translation
- Have to understand context instead of words

**_Winter 2: Micro world Translation_**    

- 1970s
- Build a micro world with clear boundaries to allow for a more specific use of AI (eg a computer therapist setting)
- Challenge was it cant respond to any question outside its vocabulary lexicon

**_Winter 3: Expert Systems_**    

- 1980s
- IBM is the major player
- Collect expert behavior / response and put them into structured digital systems

**_Breakthroug: neural network algorithm in 1980_**

- Demonstrated working potential in 2012 when Andrew Ng took Youtube still iamges and have neural network cluster data by itself: cats were identified with a 16% accuracy     
- Reasons it worked include more computer powers, more data, better algorithms and larger investment
- Tensorflow neural network
