#Strategy
--- 
1. Make eAAsySabre (agent facing booking system) access available to customers and compete on UI / operation 
2. All leading players at the time (1997ish) had a big brother portal: Travelocity's was Yahoo, Expedia's was MSN, and Preview Travel's was AOL.
3. First people went into Airline agenting but then discovered fatter margins / larger transaction sizes in hotel
4. Priceline at one point wanted to be come 'name your price' for everything but capital market at the time of tech bubble urged them to pursue verticals with best returns
