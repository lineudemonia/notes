# Data science foe executives


###1. What is data science
---
Data science is the process of formulating quantitative questions that can be answered with data, collecting and cleaning the data, analyzing the data, and communicating the answer to the question to a relevant audience.

There are always tradeoffs between: 

- interpretable
- accurate
- simple
- fast
- scalable

- Descriptive
- Statistical inference: drawing conclusions about populations from a sample
- Prediction

Structure of Data Science Project

1. Getting data
2. Ask questions (really important)
3. EDA exploratary data analysis
	- is the data suitable to answer the question
	- sketch the solution
4. Formal modeling
5. Interpretation
6. Communication
7. Decision


###Three key questions in every big data project

1. What is the question this project aims to tackle
2. Do you have the necessary data to do it?
3. Can we replicate the results of your finding to larger scale? (netflix gave US$1mm to its algorithm team but couldnt use it due to engineering capacity budget constraint)
