## Ratio Analysis
### Dupont ratio:
ROE = \\( \frac{\text{Return}}{\text{Equity}} \\)  
	=        \\(\frac{\text{Return}}{\text{Asset}} * \frac{\text{Asset}}{\text{Equity}} \\)   
	= \\(\frac{\text{Return}}{\text{Sales}} * \frac{\text{Sales}}{\text{Assets}} * \frac{\text{Assets}}{\text{Equity}} \\)  
	= Profitability * Efficiency (Asset turnover) * Leverage
	
- In calculating ROE, it makes sense to directly use reported earnings (including interest expense). 
- In calculating ROA or return over sales, one should use de-levered earnings (net income + (1- tax rate) * interest)

### Asset turnover ratios:
- AR turnover = Sales / Average AR  
- Inventory turnover = COGS / Average Inventory  
- AP turnover = (Change in inventory + COGS) / Average AP  
- Fixed assets turnover = Sales / avg net PPE

- Net Trade Cycle = Days receivable + Days inventory - Days payable


### Short-term financing ratios:
- Current ratio = Current Asset / Current liability  
- Quick ratio = (Cash + receivable) / Current liability
- CFO to current liabilities = Cash from operations / Avg current liabilities

### Interest coverage ratios:
- Interest coverage = EBITDA / Interest expense
- Cash interest coverage = (Cash from Operations + Cash Interest Paid + Cash Taxes) / Cash Interest paid

### Long-term financing ratios:
- Debt to equity = Total liabilities / Shareholder's equity
- Long term debt to equity = Total long term debt / Shareholder's equity
- Long term debt to Tangible assets = Total long term debt / (Total assets - Intangible assets)
