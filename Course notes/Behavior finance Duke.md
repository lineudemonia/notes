1. People tend to be risk-seeking in a loss FRAME, but risk-averse in a gain FRAME

###Availability heuristic:
---
- Decision makers assess the probability of an event by the ease with which instances can be brought to mind
- Individuals **overweight** the probability of a rare event when
	- Examples are easy to recall
	- There has been a recent, highly publicized occurence
- Individuals underweight higher probability risks if:
	- There are not personally aware of any recent occurences
- Examples of availability heuristic
	- Following 911, people fly less. However it is in fact safer to fly because of more security
	- A small number of public bankruptcies drive investors away from all Risky equities
- Media ia biased towards reporting unusual events, we are therefore inclined to think low-probability events are more likely than they are

### Framing / Mental accounting
---
- The way a question is phrased can have impact on one's response
- We are inclined to set up a mental budget for certain type of expenditure (an upper limit)
- It's eaiser to also purchase smaller relevant items when one's making a big purchase decision (car / house)

### Endowment Effect
---
- Once we own an item, we tend to view it as more valuable
- We have a preference of holding on to what belongs to us
- We infer an item is of greater value when it is ours

### Choosing vs Pricing
---
- Two completely different psychological process
- Choosing is not dollar-based, simply A vs B
- Pricing is dollar-based.

### Representativeness
---
-  human desire to see patterns, even where none exist
-  can generate a belief that we can predict the future, based on fallacies about what has happened in the past.
-  Gambler’s fallacy: we expect short-run sequences to be representa2ve of a long-run mean
- Non regressive prediction: Under other circumstances, we expect trends to continue indefinitely
- Conservatism: in other cases, we under-react to data that does not tally with our view on how the data “should” behaveve

### Money Management
---
- Total worldwide mutual fund more tha US$20 trillion
- US mutual fund account for slightly more than 50% of global funds
- General advice to laymen in US is to invest in passive funds rather than active funds and start saving as early as possible

### Market bubbles and crashes
---
- USD five trillion worth of oney
