###Equity premium 

- Equity performance is at 6.8% / year with inflation-corrected in the last 100 years
- The reason equity is able to continue this growth is because of its inherent risk premium
- 100% bond portfolio carries same risk vs 50% stock + 50% bond. Therefore never trade 100% bond
- Sharpe ratio for a portfolio is constant along the tangency line
	- A portfolio manager is only outperforming if he has a greater Sharpe ratio
