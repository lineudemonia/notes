42 - everything but a school. 

SYNOPSIS
42 Born 2 Code. 

DESCRIPTION
Fun. Sweat. Passion. Extraordinary means. Learning unseen digital developpement apprenticeship. Those are promises that 42 wants to uphold.

We can't do it without you.

Before leaving your passion in the company or Lab of your dreams, you'll need to work hardâ€¦ Using a pedagogy built to develop extraordinary skills in coding, 42 prepares you to answer the sharpest and most demanding needs of innovating companies. More than just a simple technical expertise, it's the excellence in coding that is aimed for.

What are the engagements you have to take to succeed your curriculum at 42? Easy... read the M.A.N.!


M for Me: My personal engagements

You have to plan for at least 50 hours of weekly work (more than 8 hours a day for 6 days). The objective of 42 is to make you, in three to five years, an accomplished professionnal able to sustain an important workload. To that goal, you'll have, from your first days til the end of your curriculum, to produce a lot of projects to train yourself. Being ahead of others because of your past knowledge is a decoy: by refusing to work, you are disadvantaging yourself compared to those who are developping the working skills to catch up with you.

Be autonomous in your curriculum. 42 lets you organize yourself as you please. Don't expect knowledge to come to you: you're becoming actor of your studies as soon as you enter the school. You'll have, once in the professional life, to be actively looking for more knowledge. Apply right now this way of working.

Be rigorous. When a project is proposed to you, you have to do it in its entirety, without omitting any guidelines and by understanding the objective. A project "almost completely" done is often a project "totally imcomplete" for us. Give special attention to details. Your only reliable source of information regarding the instructions is the pedagogical team, don't trust the "I've-heard".

You have to do all the asked exercises. 42 doesn't have any expectations about your abilities and starts computer education from zero. Every exercise is an unavoidable step of your studies. In the same way, don't start an exercise of a superior level without having completed the preceeding ones: you will be in dificulty if you do so. Practice is the only way to learn at 42 and it cannot be taken lightly.

42 doesn't provide any solutions to the exercises. The method to learn at school is based on intensive and exclusive use of practice. Giving you the solution is preventing you from finding it by yourself. You will raise a lot of questions during your curriculum at 42. We encourage you to find the answers by yourself.

Cheating is not knowing how to redo an exercise. Every student of group work not able to redo the project behind closed doors is considered a cheater. Your worst enemy is yourself: never think you know how to do it but know how to do it and show it to us.


My engagements towards other students

A peer to peer method: every one is learning from others. We learn better what we have to transmit. Based on that, during your curriculum at 42 you'll have to animate workshops, supervise exams, make people pass projects defences... You'll refine your skills by allowing others to progress at 42.

Working in a group means confronting point of views. Every member of the group is responsible for the proper advancement of the project. You have to set your objectives together, define priorities, and mostly exchange by opening up to dialogue. Every member must criticize others work in order for the group to progress. If dividing the work can look like a good idea at first, in the long run it might be harmful to your own learning process.

Your learning process is done at school. At 42 you'll progress by confronting your point of view and by doing so you will make your comrades progress as well. Thereby, you have to meet at school to work on your projects and avoid finding yourself at home alone or with a group of colleague.

Working in a group doesn't mean leaving the group to work in your place. When you think over a project with others, afterwards you must recreate it individually starting from scratch. Sometimes the emulsion of the group can create a fake sensation of having understood that only the personal practice can reveal as being false. When a member of the working group didn't succeed to redo his exercise, the group must gather again and restart the solving process.

Group problems must be solved within the group. For most of you, you'll discover a new way of working in a group. By experience, we know that many confrontations will occur. You must learn to defuse crises before they occur. Bad management of a group is not for us a reason for failing a project.


My engagements towards 42

42, a school of passionated people. The school is designed to allow all of those that doesn't recognize themself in the traditional system to be able to make their IT passion flourish. Your personal motivation must allow you to go forward in the projects proposed. When you find yourself in a tough spot, you must exchange with other students or the pedagogical team to be able to move forward. They are as passionated as you are.

An impeccable personnal attitude. By becoming actor of your own study, you cannot blame anyone for your personal mistakes. When you make a commitment, whether towards your group, the pedagogical team or the administration, you must put everything into place to honor it. This includes, amongst other, an exemplary ponctuality at every moment of your curriculum at 42.

Respect of the people and objects. You undertake not to be insulting to the team 42 and other students. You must follow all of the instructions that you are given by members of the administration and the pedagogical team. In the same way, you must not deteriorate equipment nor abuse of the ressources at your disposal. It goes without saying that illegal activities are of course prohibited.

42, an open school. To allow a peer-to-peer teaching, the school is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You are encouraged to take full advantage of it. Wrongly, some think that the words "leave" and "holidays" are meaningless. It's wrong. We think that "leave" and "holidays" are synonyms of "working in a group at 42".

An associative engagements. By integrating 42, you are committing yourself to work but also to allow 42 to last. You are integrating a community by joining 42. All of the students have a weekly quota of hours to do in the association. It can be administrative tasks, every day life or support the pedagogical team. We are expecting a citizen engagment from you.
